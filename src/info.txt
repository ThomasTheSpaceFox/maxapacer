these are the origional TIMG image files.

T-CODE is designed to translate them to  espape codes, ready to be copied into 
a bash script.

TIMGTRANS.sh is a wrapper that will translate all these files automatically 
and put them in text files with the .TC extention.
(example.TIMG would become example.TC)
if you make changes to the source TIMG images i recommend using this wrapper 
script, then copying over the appropiate files to the same directory 
as maxapacer.sh.

after that you should copy them over the .TC
